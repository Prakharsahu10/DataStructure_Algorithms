/*

Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique quads that add up to give a target value. In short, you need to return an array of all the unique quadruplets [arr[a], arr[b], arr[c], arr[d]] such that their sum is equal to a given target.

Example 1:
Input Format: arr[] = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
Result: [[-2,-1,1,2],[-2,0,0,2],[-1,0,0,1]]
Explanation: We have to find unique quadruplets from the array such that the sum of those elements is equal to the target sum given that is 0. The result obtained is such that the sum of the quadruplets yields 0.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr[] = [4,3,3,4,4,2,1,2,1,1], target = 9
Result: [[1,1,3,4],[1,2,2,4],[1,2,3,3]]
Explanation: The sum of all the quadruplets is equal to the target i.e. 9.

// Time Complexity: O(N^3)
// Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding the output array)
// Note: The output array is not included in the space complexity calculation as it is not part of the algorithm's space complexity.
// The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space to store variables and pointers. The output array is not included in the space complexity calculation as it is not part of the algorithm's space complexity.
// The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N^3) because we are using three nested loops to find the quadruplets. The outer loop runs N times, the second loop runs N times, and the inner loop runs N times, so the total time complexity is O(N^3). The two-pointer approach inside the inner loop reduces the time complexity from O(N^4) to O(N^3).
// The algorithm is efficient for finding unique quadruplets in the array that sum up to a given target value. It uses sorting and two-pointer techniques to optimize the search for quadruplets, ensuring that duplicates are avoided and the solution is found in a reasonable time frame.
