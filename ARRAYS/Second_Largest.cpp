/* Find Second Smallest and Second Largest Element in an array */
/*

Example 1:
Input:
 [1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output:
 Second Smallest : 2
    Second Largest : 5
Explanation:
 The elements are as follows 1,2,3,5,7,7 and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2

Example 2:
Input:
 [1]
Output:
 Second Smallest : -1
    Second Largest : -1
Explanation:
 Since there is only one element in the array, it is the largest and smallest element present in the array. There is no second largest or second smallest element present.
