/*
Alpha-Triangle
*/

/*

Sam is researching on Alpha-Triangles. So, he needs to create them for different integers ‘N’.

An Alpha-Triangle is represented by the triangular pattern of alphabets in reverse order.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding Alpha-Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
C
C B 
C B A
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1  <= N <= 25
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1:
C
C B 
C B A
Sample Input 2 :
1
Sample Output 2 :
A
